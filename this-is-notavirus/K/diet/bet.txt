CONSENT TO PIERCE & RELEASE OF CLAIMS
 
I acknowledge by signing this Release I have been given the full opportunity to
ask any and all questions which I might have about obtaining a piercing from                               
and all my questions have been answered to my full and total satisfaction. I
acknowledge I have been advised of the matters set forth below and I agree as
follows:
 
1. I am not pregnant or nursing. If I have any condition that might affect the
   healing of this piercing, I will inform my piercer.
2. I do not suffer from medical or skin conditions such as, but not limited to:
   keloid or hypertrophic scarring, psoriasis at the site of the piercing or
   any open wounds or lesions at the site of the piercing.
 
3. I have advised the Piercer of any allergies to metals, latex gloves, soaps
   and medications.   I acknowledge it is not reasonably possible for the
   Piercer to determine whether I might have an allergic reaction to the
   piercing or processes involved in the piercing and further acknowledge
   that such a reaction is possible.
 
4. I have trustfully represented to the Piercer I am over the age of 18 years.
   I am not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.   To my knowledge, I do
   not have any physical, mental or medical impairment or disability which
   might affect my well-being as a direct or indirect result of my decision
   to have a piercing done at this time.
 
5. I acknowledge that obtaining this piercing is my choice alone and will
   result in a permanent change to my appearance, and that no representation
   has been made to me as to the ability to later restore the skin involved
   in this piercing to its pre-piercing condition.
 
6. I acknowledge infection is always possible as a result of obtaining a
   piercing. I have received aftercare instructions and I agree to follow
   all of them while my piercing is healing.
